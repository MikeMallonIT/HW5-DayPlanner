# Homework 5 - Work Day Scheduler - Michael Mallon

## What I did
In homework 5, we were provided with HTML and CSS starter code that styled the backbone of the application. Each time-slot div which includes the time, text input and save button were added. Additional CSS formatting was also added to the sections. 

<br>

### Motivation:
The latest concept used in this application is the JavaScript moment() function. This allows the application to tell time; something very useful. Motivation on this assignment was to acquire a better understanding of local storage and learn how to trigger evens based off of time.

<br>

### Problems I solved:
    * Used moment() to display the current date
    * Used moment() to change the way HTML elements are styled
    * Built HTML elements that input and output text
    * Used local storage to save and update an array
    * Manipulated array so elements in array are displayed as calendar events
<br />
